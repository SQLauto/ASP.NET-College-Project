    <p style="top: 400px; left: 56px; position: absolute; height: 57px; width: 965px">The online reporting facility has been developed so that you can report crimes online, if you do not want to report directly to the police.  The police take crimes very seriously and will record and investigate this offence even if you do not want to give your details.  However, you must note that the investigation and ability to prosecute the offender(s) is severely limited if the police cannot contact you.</p>
    <p style="top: 460px; left: 56px; position: absolute; height: 38px; width: 965px">You may also specify how you want to be contacted and if contacting you would cause you any difficulties.  The police will not pass on your details without your consent and would ask you to consider giving your details confidentially.</p>
    <p style="top: 500px; left: 56px; position: absolute; height: 38px; width: 965px">To report a crime - please register your self and you will be taken to the correct reporting form. You can use the postcode search at www.police.in to check the name of your local area..</p>
